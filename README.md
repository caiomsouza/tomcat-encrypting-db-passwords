In this article has a statament saying: "Most search results related to debating if securing the clear text username and password is even necessary. The general consensus seemed to be this security is not necessary for two reasons. One, if an intruder compromises a production server in a way that would allow read access to server.xml then the clear text username and password is the least security concern. Two, Tomcat is a reference implementation so it shouldn't be used in a production environment.".
